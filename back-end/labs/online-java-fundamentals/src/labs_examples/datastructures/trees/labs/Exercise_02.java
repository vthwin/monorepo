    Trees: Exercise_02

    For this challenge, please research and implement a custom Trie data structure (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).

    Trie's are very interesting and useful data structures. Many interview questions, and real-world scenario's
    can be properly addressed using a Trie. We use Tries to store things like words and numbers in a highly
    efficient manner. See here: http://theoryofprogramming.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trie12.jpg

    Understanding and implement a Trie is a fantastic step in thinking creatively as a developer to
    accomplish goals as efficiently as possible.
